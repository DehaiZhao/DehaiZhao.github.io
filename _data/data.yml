    title: Profile
    summary: |
      I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Australian CSIRO's Data61 in the SE4AI team, where I lead the development of the guardrail system for Large Language Models, a key component of Responsible AI. 
      I obtained my PhD from the Research School of Computer Science at the Australian National University, with a primary focus on intelligent software engineering. 
      My research during this period delved into harnessing computer vision and deep learning techniques to address software engineering challenges, aiming to elevate the quality and efficiency of programming. 
      Additionally, I hold a keen interest in cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT).
